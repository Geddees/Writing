## The Rimefrost

The planet of Goa is tidally locked with its star, and so the habitability zone for life (life like yours at least) is quite thin.  The Immortal Cities -- Celestine, Elixir, Heraldry, and Euphoria -- all reside within and war over this zone, but there are still people who've managed to make a life in the North where the sun never reaches.

No one remembers anymore where they come from, but massive furnaces dot the frozen expanse like stars in the night. These Stars greatly vary in size and can support settlements as gigantic as any city in the south, or they could be so small that they're only really useful as a way-station for travelers. The societies formed around them are called Halos, since all the furnaces too hot to approach, let alone build near, and thus have a sort of "habitability ring" of their own. 

Life is, by no means, easy in the Rimefrost. The further North one travels, the colder and colder it gets until even the air is too thin to breathe.  The sun hardly moves in the sky, "summers" are still deadly cold and only last one or two months before the paths between Halos are too treacherous for normal folk to traverse. 

## The Rimefolk

The good people of the north are a hardened and superstitious folk, but the terrors of the cold night have not conquered the warmth in their hearts. Where the Southerners might openly stare at the Dragonkind or cower at a Goblin, strangers are hardly the strangest thing one sees in the Rimefrost. A party of Dragonkind or Orcs or Six-eyed aliens would hardly raise an eyebrow, although such a party might get a few question from curious folk.

Rimefolk do not worship gods, but they do believe that the gods are responsible for the evils visited upon their lives. The only place priests are tolerated are in larger cities, and even then only barely. The people of the Rimefrost generally credit the collapse of any Halo to "Wandering Gods" -- which, by folklore, are beings who travel the night and feast on the light of the Stars that keep the Halos warm.

## Empire of the Black Sun
---

The Rimefolk may belong to one Halo or another, but Heroes belong to none but their own conscience. Here in the Northern Wastes, society is held together by extraordinary folks like you who stand against the many terrors of the night.  

In recent nights, tales speak of the dawn of a new master, called The Many-Eyed God. Wherever its servants go, death follows in its wake. Rumors tell of entire Halos dissapearing overnight. The Rimefolk dare not speak of what happens to the people who are lost -- or of the Black Stars that now loom over the once great Halos of the North.

### Overview
The star which Red Lamp surrounds goes out due to the workings of mysterious cult. The heroes will make tough, often life-and-death decisions to save the people of this Halo and lead them to safety.

## The Azure Myth
---

The elite guard for The Lady in Blue, mysterious leader of the Immortal City of Elixir, have been tasked with collecting an artefact from deep in Northern Wastes -- a blade forged to kill a Wandering God. You have been at this for months now, learned of the Rimefolk who live in this endless frozen night, and yet have found nothing like what The Lady described. That is, until you hear rumor of a long-dead Halo, their star now cold as the Wastes and dark as the godless sky. Surely the next Halo you visit will know the way there.

### Overview

After an intro (RP, intro fight) the heroes finally find a lead on their god-killing blade. Our story begins in full-swing as the heroes' journey into the dark is more terrible than anything they've ever faced before. 

## The City in the Middle of the Night
---

One by one the kingdoms fell, the great Wandering Gods looked upon the Halos of the North and took it all. All but one. Gravestone -- The City in the Middle of the Night -- shines ever brighter against the all-consuming dark of the dead world which surrounds her. But these days, rumors of a new Wanderer haunt the streets of your beautiful city. A new god who thirsts for what all gods desire. Light.

### Overview

Although night have been getting colder and colder, the heroes discover that heat from the star that warms Gravestone is being sold to highest bidder. Those who've stolen from the good people of your city must be brought to justice.
