### What Is This Game All About?
Larger than life, extraordinary heroes plunging into battle against terrifying, monstrous enemies

Featuring:
- Dungeons
- Wilderness
- Exploration
- Horror

But all in a heroic fantasy wrapper!  The game is not a desperate battle to survive, nor is it a complex survival puzzle.  This game is about *extraordinary people* doing *extraordinary things*.

#### Some Guidelines For Making Your Game Cool
- Make it Tactical
	- Remember to think 2 or 3 steps ahead.
 	- *How* are we going to do that? *Should* we do that? *Who* is best for this task?
 	- Remember that *positioning matters*. 
 	- Remember that *teamwork matters*.
 - Make it Heroic
	 + The assumption is that your character is primarily motivated by an internal drive to do the right thing.
	 + But also! The general assumption is that your character *knows what they're doing*. They're heroes! Of course they can carry one more sword! Of course they would have remembered to bring a spare climbing rope!  Don't worry about food rations, your character obviously remembered to bring enough.  You're a hero -- you're good at this!
- Make it Cinematic
	+ Your powers and abilities have a strong visual component. Remember to use this *as well as* the literal text of the ability.
	+ The character classes have a *vibe* to each of them -- try to be aware of that as you pick the class, but also as you're playing them!  Your tactician is *meant* to coordinate the battle.  The shadow is *meant* to be in, well, the shadows.
- Make it Fantasy
	+ Dragons and shit baybeeeeeeeeeee
	+ The game basically assumes and explicitly supports a "fantasy land" setting. Try as one might to make a sci-fi, you're just gonna have a better time setting it in The Lord of the Rings rather than Star Trek.

### For The DnD Folks
In my person opinion, the designers of Draw Steel shot for a "4e, but more streamlined" vibe -- so the vets amongst us will notice terms like, or similar to: Dazed, Marked, Burst 5, Triggered Actions, ect.

There are, however, quite a few differences between this game and the DnD games we been running over the years.  I'll try to give a few highlights right at the beginning so we're all prepared for the rest of this packet.

#### Attacks automatically deal damage
You can't miss, but you *can* still have a bad turn. Because of this, fights are never about *Can we even hit them?* and more about *Are we strong enough to kill them before they kill us?*

Attack rolls in Draw Steel generally dictate damage and, often, extra effects. No more *I missed, and I guess that's my turn* -- instead you'll have turns that look like *Oh shit, I only did 6 damage and this Balrog is about to end my family line.* 

#### Resting = Health, Fighting = Resources
Draw Steel incentivises you to fight on, because your resources build as you fight throughout the day.  Mana builds up as you do heroic actions; your Warrior can windmill 6 goblins in one turn only after a *whole day* of building their bloodthirst.

It's your HP that you need to rest to recover. This is meant to be the central tension, I believe, of the adventuring day.  "If we push on just one more fight, I finally have enough mana to use my most powerful spell -- but I also only have 5hp remaining!"

#### Classes are similar, but different
I just encourage everyone to look at the classes before you decide to play one.  Conduit certainly *looks* like a Cleric, but you're setting yourself up for dissapointment if you don't read what they actually do before you roll one up.

#### There are lots of skills (Athletics, Acrobatics, Diplomacy)
Like, a lot.

From what I can tell, we don't need to memorize them -- they seem like they're more for character customization than anything else. But they are pretty cool!

#### There are psionics in this game
Yep.  I know not everyone likes this, but they're basically set up like Jean Grey or The Scarlet Witch.  

I'm sure we'll have to discuss this -- and I'm pretty happy to leave it out if we come to that decision.

#### There's a number crunch
This is probably the big one for most of you.

We're only using 2d10 for basically the whole game.  Additionally, even for this roll, we're rarely using the total on the dice -- instead the results come in 3 "tiers" of outcomes which dictate a set amount of damage, a set condition, or a set amount of healing.

Because of this, you generally have a better understanding of how well a player at the table is doing. A 12 is *always* a pretty good result, a 17 is *always* the best result. But also -- an 11 is *always* just one tick away from success. A 16 is *always* just one tick away from a huge success.

Players around the table should have a better time participating in other players' rolls, but also, the characters who give a bonus to rolls will feel *really* powerful. When your ally rolls an 11, you should be thinking -- "I don't know what your 12 does, but I know it's probably better than an 11. Take a plus one to this roll."

## The Basics
True to it's 4th edition roots, Draw Steel is built on the assumption that we're fighting on a grid.  The combat is relatively granular, and requires the players at the table to be paying attention to each other's turns.  

That said, the designers have set most non-combat functions up to work more like a conversation between the players and the director (this game's DM). Expect rules for **Negotiation** and **Skill Tests** to follow the rules for **Combat** and **Character Creation**.

### Dice
This is probably not *super* necessary but please note that, in addition to the 2d10s we're rolling, you'll be using the occasional d6 as well as the rare d3. One or two of those would be useful to have, but of course we have a ton for everyone to use if they don't mind drawing from the pound of dice.

### Character Stats
Ability Scores:

- **Might** - Strength.  This is kicking down doors, swinging an axe, hurling an ally over a chasm.
- **Agility** - Dexterity. This is your coordination and nimbleness.  Backflipping out of danger, shooting a crossbow, dodging an explosion, pickpocketing a guard.
- **Reason** - Intelligence. This your ability to solve a puzzle that unlocks a door, recall lore about an ancient society, but also blast your foes with Psionic power.
- **Intuition** - Wisdom. This is your ability to hear the approach of a distant rider, intuit a player's tell at a poker table, calm a rearing horse, track a monster across the tundra.
- **Presence** - Charisma. This is your force of personality, you ability to impress a queen at a royal banquet, to whip a crowd into a rebellion, and to cast a spell by singing a song.

Your scores run from -5 to +5, higher is better.  An average human has a score of 0, a baby bunny might have a score of -5, and an ancient dragon would have a +5.

You add these scores to your power rolls -- everything from attacks to skill checks -- and use the total to determine the outcome.

### Power Rolls
When you want  to do something that isn't an obvious success -- attacking, leaping over tall buildings in a single bound, sneaking by a guard -- you're going to make a power roll to see if you succeed and by how much you succeed.

#### Types of Power Rolls

Ability - When activating an ability, this determines how much damage it does, how far the enemy is pushed, how severe the status effect they would suffer.

 Resistance - When resisting a status effect from another creature's ability or from the environment, you would make this roll and subtract the creature's relevant ability score.

 Tests - Usually used against the environment or when interacting with something that's not actively resisting you. You might make this to scale a cliff, to intimidate a cultist, to pickpocket a guard.

#### Making a Power Roll
Pretty straightforward, just roll 2d10 and add your relevant ability score to the result. The relevant score depends on what you're doing -- usually the game tells you what to add, if not, the Director will.

Your outcomes, as previously mentioned, are organized into tiers:

- Tier 1: Rolling an **11 or lower**. The worst result you can have -- this generally means that you haven't done much damage for an ability roll, or that you have failed a test roll.  Often, there are negative consequences for this result.
- Tier 2: Rolling a **12 to 16**. This is the average result (mathematically), and so it means that you will make a moderate impact on whatever you're attempting.  An attack will do a moderate amount of damage, and on a test will mean that you succeed.  If the test is very hard, you will succeed at a cost.
- Tier 3: Rolling a **17 or higher**. This is the best result you can have.  Generally, this means that you succeed *and* have something else cool happen.  An attack roll might deal a ton of damage, or blast multiple foes, or inflict a lasting status effect.  For a test, it would mean that you succeed and get something extra -- more info, you can help someone else across that chasm, you intimidate that cultist so much they pass out.

A couple notes on these Power Roll tiers -- 

- You can absolutely downgrade your successes.  If you roll a tier 3 success but only want the result of a tier 1, just let the Director know.
- Rolling a natural 19 or 20 (this is a 19 or 20 on the dice *without* adding or subtracting modifiers) will **always** result in a tier 3 result **regardless of applicable modifiers**.

#### Edges and Banes
These are situational advantages and disadvantages that players get for their power rolls.  Often, the Director is adding these based on the current scene, but there are also abilites that have these same effects.

- **Edge** - represents a situational *advantage* a player or enemy might have when making a power roll. **One Edge give you +2 to the roll** and **more than one Edge automatically improves the roll by one tier**.

- **Bane** - represents a situational *disadvantage* a player or enemy might have when making a power roll.  They work the same way in opposite -- **one Bane is a -2**, **two or more Banes automatically decreases the result by one tier**.

Note: Banes and Edges *do* cap at 2. So having 5 Edges will give the same advantage as 2 Edges.

Note Note: Banes and Edges also cancel each other out.  One Edge and one Bane means that you roll normally, Two Edges and one Bane would mean that you roll with one Edge.

Note Note Note: There are also *rare* instances where players and enemies get flat Bonuses and Penalties to their rolls.  We just add these together -- no limit. Lots of math.  Again, pretty rare.

## The Heroic Narrative
Draw Steel seeks to mimic the storytelling we might find in an epic fantasy novel or TV show -- think Game of Thrones or The Lord of the Rings -- and so organizes its adventuring mechanics around growth over the course of time.  This is not necessarily *just* over the course of a campaign, over an entire season of TV or a book trilogy, but also over the course of a day!  


The adventuring narrative is made up of four important mechanics.

### Victories
Your hero's power increases as you build adrenaline throughout the day -- every battle you win, every test you succeed give you just a little more confidence to be the best version of *you.*

These are reflected in Victories, which build up like points for individual characters when you win a combat encounter, when you successfully overcome a large skills test, or a difficult negotiation. 

**Additionally** your Victories directly impact the current "floor" of the class resource you have to spend.  
E.g. The Conduit has **Piety equal to their Victories** at the start of battle and gains two per turn.  The Fury has **Rage equal to their Victories** at the start of battle and gains 1d3 Rage per turn. 

Outside of combat, your characters just have a resource equal to their Victories -- you can spend it as much as you want, and it only takes 1 minute to recover your resource back up to your current Victory watermark.

This is also not to be confused with *spending* your Victories during the adventuring day.  Your Heroic resources are simply *equal* to your current number of Victories. Victories reset at the end of the day, where they're consumed into Experience -- there isn't a way to spend them other than that.

### Experience
I think this is pretty straightforward -- when you take a Respite (next section), you gain Experience equal to your Victories and then reset your Victories to 0.

Here's the Advancement Table:


~~~ 
XP			Level
---			---
0–9				1
10–24			2
25–39			3
40–54			4
55–69			5
70–84			6
85–99			7
100–114			8
115–129			9
130+			10
~~~

### Recoveries
Your Hero has a limited number of Recoveries that they can use to heal themselves.

Players can use these with the *Catch Breath* action, which allows you to spend a Recovery, some Classes have abilities which allow for players to spend recoveries, and you can of course spend as many Recoveries as you'd like when not in combat.  Just rememeber, you have a limited number of them.

Recoveries regain Stamina (HP) equal to your **recovery value**, which is 1/3 of your Stamina Maximum.

You recover all of these then you finish a Respite.

### Respite
In Draw Steel, a Respite is 24 hours of resting.  No marching, no fighting, no negotiations or skill tests.

Following a Respite, your Hero recovers all Stamina and Recoveries, resets Victories and gains Experience.  They can even take a Respite activity, which is something like Research and Crafting, or they can change their Kit (which is their Armor/Weapons).

Please note that the standard 8 hours of sleep doesn't count as a Respite -- your hero does obviously sleep, but sleep does not a Respite make.

## How Combat Works

### Side Initiative

We'll roll a d10 to see who goes first (6+ players go first, under 5 the monsters go).  If the players win initiative, one player can decide to take their turn in whatever order the team determines is best. After that player has acted, then the turn will pass to the enemies, who will choose one their own to take a turn.  Continue until everyone's had a turn.

If there are more people on one side, then whichever team has more will take all their remaining turns without trading back and forth with the other side.

### Taking a Turn
Turns are broken down into 3 actions -- a **Movement** a **Maneuver** and an **Action**.  A player may take these actions in any order, they can split movement between actions, and they can downgrade their **Action** into a **Movement** or **Maneuver** at will. **Movement** and **Maneuvers** are not interchangeable -- you will always take at least one of these, if not two with a downgraded **Action**.

Also we have **Triggered Actions**, which are basically Reactions from 5e -- they seem super similar to 4e as well. You do have your generalized **Triggered Actions** -- Attacks of Opportunity for instance -- but classes also have unique **Triggered Actions** with unique conditions that trigger them.

One **Triggered Action** per character, per round. Just like the good old days. **BUT** there are also **Free Triggered Actions** which players have an unlimited number of them per round. There seem to be a lot of these.

Please note that, if there are multiple **Triggered Actions** at once, the players decide amongst themselves what order the actions resolve.

### Movement
Movement isn't in feet -- it's in squares.  This is generally granted by your ancestry, and it's usually 5.  There are other things that can make you faster or slower -- armor, class, title, to name a few.

**Shifting** makes a return to the game.  Instead of using your **Movement**, you can **Shift** up to half your current speed.  When shifting, you do not provoke **Opportunity Attacks**.

### Forced Movement
There are a ton of abilities that move enemies in this game and, because of this, there are rules for throwing enemies **into each other**, **into the air**, **slamming into walls**, and **smashing them through walls**.

In general, forced movement is marked as **Push X**, **Pull X**, and **Slide X**.  Push and Pull work the way you imagine they would (if you have leftover pull distance, enemies just stop when they reach you.  So a Pull 5 from 3 away will just pull 3.) and Slide allows you to move creatures in any direction other than vertically.

The **Vertical** keyword allows players to force movement vertically.  So it would look like "Vertical Push 5" and it would allow you to Push an ememy 5 squares, any amount of them may be in a vertical direction.

#### Stability
Creatures have a stability score which allows them to resist forced movement. Generally, this score is just subtrated from the forced move. Heroes have 0 stability, but can increase that through a number of character creation options.

Example: Push 5 against a Stability 2 creature is pushed 3.

#### Slamming Into Creatures
If you force move a creature into another creature, the movement ends and **both** creatures take 1 damage for each square remaining in the forced move. If you move a very large creature into a crowd of smaller creatures, they would of course all take damage if that's realistic. Also, you can force move creatures into yourself if you feel like taking being a badass for whatever reason.

#### Smashing Through Walls
Not just walls, but really anything it would make sense to get smashed through.  

When a creature is force moved into a non-magical object, take a note of how much movement is remaining in the forced move.  

- 1 square remaining will smash through 1 square of **glass**. The moved creature takes 1 damage.
- 3 squares remaining will smash through 1 square of **wood**. The moved creature takes 3 damage.
- 6 squares remaining will smash thorugh 1 square of **stone**. The moved creature takes 6 damage.
- 9 squares remaining will smash through 1 square of **metal**. The moved creature takes 9 damage.

If a creature is moved into a non-magical object, but doesn't have enough movement remaining to break through, the creature stops and takes 1 damage for each remaining square of movement.

### Maneuvers

Maneuvers are usually quick actions, pretty similar to a bonus action.  You get one a turn, and can use your action to take a second one if you like.

- Aid Attack
	- Mark an enemy, the next attack against that enemy gets an edge.
- Drink Potion
	- Drink a potion!
- Escape Grab
	- Make a resistance roll to escape a grab. You take a Bane if they're bigger than you.
	- *11 or lower*: Fail to escape a grab.
	- *12-16*: Escape the grab, but the creature gets a free strike on you.
	- *17+*: Escape the grab, no free strike.
- Grab
	- You make a power roll to see if you grab a creature either your size or smaller. Reach 1.
	- *11 or lower*: Grab fails.
	- *12-16*: Grab works, but the creature gets a free strike on you.
	- *17+*: Grab works, no free strike.
	- Effect: You gain an edge on the power roll if the creature's size is smaller than yours. You can grab only one creature at a time this way.
- Hide
	- Roll to hide, only works if they can't see you hide.
- Knockback
	- Make a Power Roll to shove a creature your size or smaller away from you.
	- *11 or lower*: Push 1.
	- *12-16*: Push 2.
	- *17+*: Push 3.
	- Effect: Gain an edge on the Power Roll if the creature's size is smaller than yours.
- Make or Assist a Test 
	+ There are lots of Test you could make during combat -- lifting a portcullis, picking a door's lock, ect.
- Search for Hidden Creatures
	- Pretty self-explanatory
- Stand Up
	- If you're prone, use this to stand up. ALSO, you can use this to stand up an adjacent prone ally.

### Actions

Generally, you're using the unique actions that come along with your character -- either their class, ancestry, career, kit, ect.

That being said, there are a number of actions that all player characters can take if it comes down to it.

- Catch Breath
	- Use this to spend a Recovery. You also take the Defend action for free if you use this.
- Charge
	- Move up to your speed in a straight line, then make a melee free strike against a creature at the end of your move.
- Defend
	- All attacks against you have a double bane until the end of your next turn.  **PLEASE NOTE** that creatures taunted by you are not affected by this action.
- Free Strike
	- This is either punching or using an improvised weapon.  You also use this action when taking an Opportunity Attack.
- Heal
	- Use this action to allow another creature to spend a Recovery or make a Resistance Roll against a status effect marked (resistance ends).
	
#### Free Strikes
Melee Free Strikes
Reach 1

- *11 or lower*: 2 damage
- *12-16*: 6 damage
- *17+*: 9 damage 

Ranged Free Strikes
Reach 5

- *11 or lower*: 2 damage
- *12-16*: 5 damage
- *17+*: 8 damage 
	
#### Opportunity Attacks
These work just like 5e, except that you take a Free Strike instead of a swing.  ALSO this is a **free triggered action** so, you get an unlimited number of these, not just one.  If you have a bane or double bane against them, you may not make the strike.

#### Concealment
If you're concealed, either by cover or otherwise, attacks against you take a bane. If you're completely hidden, you get an edge when attacking and creatures that can't see you can't make attacks against you. The action breaks your stealth as you might expect.

#### Damage Weakness and Immunity
Damage Weakness means you add damage on top of the damage taken.  For example: Fire Weakness 3 creature takes 8 damage from a 5 damage fire attack.

Damage Immunity works the exact same way but in reverse. Fire Immunity 3 reduces fire damage by 3.

### Stamina
This is your HP! It differs for tons of different reason, including ancestry, class, kit, ect.

#### Recoveries
All heroes have a set number of recoveries determined by their class. When used, the hero recovers 1/3 of their stamina max rounded down.  You can use them with the Catch Breath action, a number of items, some abilites, and a number of other effects.

#### Winded 
This is basically bloodied -- you have the condition when your stamina reaches 1/2 your max stamina.  You can tell when other creatures are winded, and others can tell when you're winded.

Winded doensn't have any particular effects, but there are a number of abilites that play off of it.

#### Dying and Death
When you Stamina is 0 or lower, you're dying, but you don't go down unless you want to! All player characters can just power through and fight on.  

While dying, you can't use Catch Breath and whenever you make a Might or Agility test, make an attack, take an action, maneuver, or triggered action, you take **1d6 damage to your Stamina**.

The only way to recover Stamina while dying is by having your allies help you spend Recoveries, or by spending your own Recoveries out of combat.  If you don't have any Recoveries out of combat, you're still dying until you take a Respite.

If you Stamina every reaches negative your **Winded** value, you die. Resurrection is pretty rare. Good luck.

### Ending a Combat
The Director generally sets an objective when planning a combat. Unless you're fighting a battle against an important villian to the end, the fight is over when the objective is fulfilled. If it do it right (and there's no guarantee I will), you will have an idea of what the objective is when the battle begins.

You don't need to know these objectives, but I'll list a few as an example.

- Diminish Numbers
	- The fight is over when it's clear the heroes outnumber the monsters.
- Destroy the Thing!
	- Smash the Lich's phylactery.
- Hold Them Off!
	- Hold the monsters off for a specific number of turns.

At the end of the fights, the players generally all get one Victory.  Two Victories if it's a particularly hard fight.

## How Negotiation Works
Negotiation is a pretty large cornerstone of this game! It's set up sort of like RP combat. It's pretty free-form on the player's end, but it's probably pretty important to understand how it's working on my end.

It's also important to remember that negotiation doesn't give you mind control powers over the NPCs you're negotiating with. This is not a process that changes the fundamental character of the NPC, rather it's a process that makes an NPC understand how behaving in a different way is **in character**.

### Negotiating NPC Stats
The target of a negotiation has 2 stats to keep track of: 

**Interest**
- This ranges from 0 to 5, and represents how interested the NPC is in continuing negotiations. If the NPC reaches 5, they make a final offer and the negotiation ends, and if they reach 0 the negotiation ends without a deal.
- Interest increases and decreases based on the arguements the heroes make.

**Patience**
- This ranges from 0 to 5, and represents how much more time and effort the NPC is willing to put into the negotiation.  At 0, they make a final offer and the negotiation ends.
- Patience only decreases over the course of the negotiation.
- If at least one hero negotiating with an NPC speaks the same language (not including Common) the the NPC's patience increases by 1 (up to the max of 5).  If there are 3 or more heroes who speak the NPC's language, their patience increases by 2.

Additionally, NPCs have 2 types of traits that inform the negotiation.

**Motivations**
- If players make an arguement during the negotiation that matches any of their motivations, they get to make an easier power roll to increase the NPC's interest.
- You can only appeal to the same motivation once. 

**Pitfalls**
- These work in the reverse of motivations. Using a pitfall during a negotiation decreases the NPC's patience and interest.

**Examples of Motivations and Pitfalls**

- Discovery
	+ An NPC with a Discovery motivation wants to learn about new lore, forgotten places, or uncover artifacts lost to time.
	+ An NPC with a Discovery pitfall would be afraid of new places, people, or ideas.  It could be that they were once in pursuit of a certain discovery, but it turned out poorly for them.
- Higher Authority
	+ An NPC with a Higher Authority motivation works towards the goals of a person or god they believe is higher than themself.
	+ An NPC with a Higher Authority pitfall scoffs at the idea of serving someone. They might not even believe in the gods at all.
	
### Starting a Negotiation
When starting a negotiation, the NPC the heroes are speaking with will have a starting attitude which determines their starting **Patience** and **Interest**. 


There are several different starting attitudes, but a few examples would be:

A **hostile** NPC would start with Interest 1 and Patience 2

An **open** NPC would start with Interest 3 and Patience 3

A **trusting** NPC would start with Interest 3 and Patience 5

Additionally, NPCs will have **Motivations** and **Pitfalls** (usually just one of each), that the players will have to figure out by making arguements or making a Reason, Intuition, or Presence Power Roll. (Hopefully my acting skills will queue everyone in as well. Hopefully...)

In a Roleplaying scene, the players will make an arguement towards **why** the NPC should give them what they want -- whether that's information, a company of soldiers, a magic item, or perhaps just passage through an enemy controlled area.

After an arguement is made, the players will roll a Reason, Intuition, or Presence Power Roll.

If the heroes correctly appeal to the NPC's motivation:

- *11 or lower*: The NPC's patience decreases by 1

- *12-16*: The NPC's interest increases by 1, and patience decreases by 1.

- *17+*: The NPC's interest increases by 1, and their patience doesn't change.

If the heroes do not appeal to a motivation or a pitfall:

- *11 or lower*: The NPC's patience decreases by 1 and their interest decreases by 1.

- *12-16*: The NPC's patience decreases by 1.

- *17+*: The NPC's interest increases by 1, and their patience decreases by 1.

If you use a pitfall, the arguement automatically fails and the NPC's interest and patience decreases by 1.

Once the NPC's interest and patience has been resolved, the heroes can either decide to keep going or stop.  If the heroes decide to continue, they just make another arguement. 

If they decide to stop, then they accept the current offer (or lack thereof) on the table.  The  current offer on the table is a reflection of the NPC's **Interest**

Interest 5: Offer is "Yes, and..."
- The offer will be exactly what the players ask for, and the NPC will offer more.  For instance, a guild master might be persuaded to aid the heroes in an upcoming war AND would speak on their behalf to the king of another nation.

Interest 4: Offer is "Yes"

Interest 3: Offer is "Yes, but..."
- The offer will be what the heroes ask for, but will probably come at a price.  The NPCs all want something too! For example, said guildmaster from the above example might be persuaded to help in the war, BUT they want you to release a spy of theirs that you have custody.

Interest 2: Offer is "No, but..."
- The offer is denied, BUT they offer something like a halfway measure.  Following the above examples, the guildmaster declines to help in the war, BUT they'll put in a good word for you with the king of another nation who might be more inclined to help.

Interest 1: Offer is "No"

Interest 0: Offer is "No and..."
- You fucked up.  The heroes don't get what they want AND the NPC they're negotiating with will outright seek to harm the heroes.  They might send assassins after you, attack right away, actively dissuade others from helping you, ect.

I think for the first of these negotiations, I'll probably actively tell you the numbers and where you are on the track.  Afterwards, I'll see if we can do this without the help of the numbers.  Hell, if we can cut the numbers and do this in the first run, I will.

## How Skills Work

### Skills
As stated above, there are a ton of skills in Draw Steel. They're quite useful, but the dice math in this game sort of means that everyone is pretty good at everything. The general suggestion is that you take skills that feel flavorful to your character, and utilize them creative ways. Lots of Director advice here to allow Players to do things like utilize their Climbing skill in a Negotiation if the player is trying to impress someone with a story of them climbing a treacherous mountain.

#### Skill Groups
Skills are grouped up into:

- Crafting
	+ Alchemy (bombs, potions)
	+ Architecture (buildings, vehicles)

	+ Forgery (faking stuff like docs and badges)
	+ Jewelry (bracelets, crowns, rings)
	+ Mechanics (machines and clockwork)
	+ Tailoring (cloth and leather clothing)

### Skill Tests
These are skill tests just like you would make in any edition of DnD. If this is the first section you're reading, then I advise you jump back to combat because the rolling works exactly the same way with the 2d10 and tiered outcomes.

For anyone left behind, these are just 2d10 rolls that you make in response to some task in the game that isn't a rote task.  You roll 2d10s, add the relevant stat, and let the Director know the total.

Generally, the tiers of success are organized into the Yes, and -- Yes -- Yes, but -- No, but -- No -- No, and -- format, over which the three tiers of outcomes will shift according to the relative difficulty of the test. As one might expect, natural 19s and 20s are an automatic success with a reward.  

**And easy test's outcomes might look like:**

*11 or lower*: Task failed

*12 - 16*: Task success

*17 or higher*: Task success, AND you get something extra

**Something very hard might look like:**

*11 or lower*: Task failed, AND you incur a consequence

*12 - 16*: Task fail

*17 or higher*: Task success

All of these tiers will be set by me, and at my discretion, but I'll do my best to follow the guidelines above as close as I can.

#### Assisting a Test
To assist, you need to both have a relevant skill AND a skill that isn't already being used on the test. No doubling up on a Jump test, but the first player can use Jump and you can assist with Climb or Lead maybe.

After that, you just roll to assist:

*11 or lower*: You make things worse. The other player takes a bane.

*12-16*: You help! The other player takes an edge.

*17 or higher*: You're a rockstar! The other player takes a double edge.

#### Group Tests
When everyone's trying to all do the same task (climbing a tower, jumping a chasm, hiding from a patrol) the Director will call for a **group test.**

The way these work is that everyone will make the same skill check as if they were doing it alone, but the outcome will be determined based on the number of fails vs sucesses, then the number of rewards vs consequences.

If half or more of the party succeeds, the whole group succeeds, and if half or more of the party *also* gets a reward, then the whole party does.

Of course, if more than half fail or get consequences, then the whole party does as well.

#### Montage Tests
These are exactly skill challanges from 4e.  If we do one at the table, I'll explain them then.
