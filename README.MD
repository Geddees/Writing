## Quick rundown for draft lingo (in case I forget)

The order of writing drafts as it stands now
- Rough
    - This is more of a brainstorming session, often I will write stupid shit that I would never, ever put in the final.  Sometimes, I'll skip entire sections if I don't know what I want to do.
- Stab
    - This is the first attempt to write the story "in voice." Often, I will simply drop characters I don't like without going to back to correct.  Sometimes, I will write horrible prose or really great prose, but we're really just trying to get the story onto the page.  Fix it in post, we can edit prose, we can't edit story structure so focus on that.
- First Draft
    - Pretty self explanatory, but this is just the first attempt to write the story without allowing for the bad shit to stay.  By far the most obsessive draft.  We're not going to allow bad prose to sit.  No more "fix it in post" this is post.
- Second Draft
    - This draft is for voice.  Often, after writing what we want, there's a lot of good shit in there, but it's just not in line with what the character would say or with how our narrator has been speaking for this story.  Here's where we fix that.
- Final
    - Only here to remind myself that it's done. No more editing.  Send it in to someone who can pay you for it.  If they don't take it, send it into someone else.  Good luck.
