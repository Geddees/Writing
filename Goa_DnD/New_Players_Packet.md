# New Players Packet

This packet is being written for three groups of people:

- You just want a quick overview for how to make a character.
	+ You're in the right place! Jump to "Making a Hero."

- You've never learned a system other than 5e!
	+ You're in good company!  Most of the people you'll be playing with have only ever played 5e.  This system, thankfully, isn't a massive departure from the game we all know and love -- but it *does* have a few quirks.
	+ The Vet Player's packet is aimed towards getting everyone else at the table up to speed, so you'll have plenty of players to help you out if you have questions.  Also, Rob and I will have the rules down and extensively discussed, so if you're feeling uncomfy at the table, ask to move towards Rob or me.
	+ Finally! If you're reading this and thinking to yourself "Should I just read the rules and help Nick at the table?" Then, yes please! Jump over to the Vet Players packet and, if you're mostly following it, take a crack at the rules.  The more people who know what's going on, the better experience we're all going to have and the more story we're going to get through.
	
- You're completely new to tabletop games!
	+ I believe in you! Ask for help at the table if you need it! Almost half of the table originally learned DnD with me as their DM, and at least a couple of them have taught groups of their own. Tabletop games can be complicated and there are a of couple concepts that can be tough to grasp at first, but we've all been there. For some of us, pretty recently!
	+ Finally, remember that -- more than the story, the combat, negotiation, kingdoms, and intrigue -- pen and paper RPGs are about sitting around the table and rolling dice with your friends.
	
As you can see, this packet is aimed at a pretty wide audience of players so, please, if you get to a section and think "I know all this..." just skip it. And, of course, if you have questions, text me or DM me or ask me next time you see me.  Everyone knows how much I love talking about this stuff, so you really have no excuse not to ask.
	
## How The Heck is This Game Going to Work If We Don't Know What We're Doing??

Hey, great question! To put it simply, we're going to take it really slow and speed up as the session goes along. 

Anyone who's reading *nothing* about the rules (don't worry if that's you!) will PLEASE arrive by 7:15 to get a rundown of how to play. At this early session, we'll spend our time until 8pm just going through a quick overview of the rules and walking through a "danger room" combat.  Even if you don't get the rules down 100% here, don't worry! We're only shooting for about 50% understanding at this stage. Repetition is key, so we're going to do it all over again when the game starts.

Game starts at 8! Get to know everyone, position yourself near someone who knows the rules (probably Rob or myself), and we'll jump into the game as quick as we can. (Presumably after 20 minutes of chatting with the new people and eating peanut butter and jelly tortillas.)

The game's going to open with an RP session and a combat, sorry to spoil. During the RP session, I'll have people make Skill Tests periodically -- looking around, intuiting what someone's thinking, persuading them to do something -- just to get everyone used to rolling the dice and, frankly, used to playing their character with new people. The combat session will be low stakes.  We're just trying to figure things out.  Slow and steady; questions encouraged. I'm imagining the Vet players will come into the game at around 80% understanding of the rules, so this (hopefully!) will get them up to around 95%.  Enough that I'm not worrying about them.

After that, we're just gonna play a game! Ask questions all you want, but try to direct them towards Rob (or any other person you deem a rules expert) at this point. Of course, if there's still something you need me for (some rules really are just gut calls), ask away -- that's what I'm there for!

I'm aiming for the game to end by 12am but I've never sucessfully done that once in my life, so let me know if you need a place to sleep or if you need to cut out at a certian time. Take care of yourself, the game's not more important than making it to work the next day.
